    <h1>Demand Distictions</h1>
    <P><b>if two goods are substitute(like tea and coffee),the cross elasticity between them is positive</b>,<i>that is,in response to a rise in price of one good the demand for the other good rises. On the</i><u> other hand, whent two goods are complementary(tea and sugar) to each other,the cross elasticity </u><mark>between them</mark> is negative so that a price of one lead to a fall in the quantity demanded of the other. However, one need not base the classification of the good on the basis of the above definations. While the goods between which cross elasticity is positive can be called substitues, the goods between which cross elasticity is negative are not always complementary.This is becuase negative cross elasticity is negative are not always complementary. This is because negative are not always complementary. This is because negative cross elasticity is also found when the income effect of the price change is very strong </P>
